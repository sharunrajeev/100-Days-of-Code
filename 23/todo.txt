Step 1
------
Create a turtle which starts from the bottom of the screen to the top. It's positioned at the middle.
Turtle should move up and down on keypress.

Step 2
------
Create car using two square turtles. Let it move from right end to left end.
Create multiple cars with similar features but different colours.
Randomly generate positions in the y-axis so each car could move at different positions.

Step 3
------
When turtle reaches the top of the screen, it levels up by where the car movement increases.
Also show the level in the top left corner.

Steps 4
-------
If the turtle collides with any of the cars, the game stops and shows game over.
